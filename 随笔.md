I would like to discuss the topics about how to maintain physical health. I guess that most of the attendees today are developers, so I think this topic is also relevant to you, even if you are a student. You also experience some health problems due to heavy academic homework.

Like programmers they may need to sit for ten hours a day. As we all know , Prolonged sitting can cause significant damage to your body. In China, there is a saying called "programmer's crisis at the age of 35".  This is not only because the competition for programmer is fierce, but also because various health problems begin to appear in older programmers. Their bodies can no longer handle high-pressure work.

For my example, I have some health issues with my Wrist and eyes , sometimes also suffer from Insomnia. 
Insomnia is hard to fall asleep at night , I also some people eat 褪黑素 to help them fall asleep. 

However, as far as I know, some programmers tend to be more efficient at night because they are less likely interrupted by meetings during the day and have more time for coding.

Do you have any suggestions on how to maintain physical health? Feel free to share your thoughts.
